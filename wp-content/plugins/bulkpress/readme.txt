Easily add and manage multiple categories, pages, custom taxonomy terms and custom post type posts. Create and reorder terms in a blink, making the tedious process of managing vast amounts of posts and terms just a walk in the park.

== Description ==

New in version 0.2! You can now easily reorganize your term hierarchy using a simple drag-and-drop interface! Re-assign term parents in just seconds!

Adding multiple categories in WordPress can be a real pain. When you want categories for every Country in the world, it is a horrible job to fill out and submit the new category form hundreds of times, especially if you're adding terms that have a hierarchy!

BulkPress makes this process much easier, by providing you with an easy-to-user interface to add categories (and terms of custom taxonomies) and pages/posts (and posts of custom post types) in bulk, giving you the option to specify a hierarchy in the added posts or terms.

BulkPress can spare you hours of your time, just try and find out for yourself!

= More to come... =
BulkPress will be updated with new functionalities very regularly. What to think of the following features coming to your WordPress installations soon...
* Mass add users
* Specify attributes for the pages you're creating in bulk, such as the page template
* [done!] Editing terms and posts in bulk, allowing you to add a whole group of terms to a parent term
* Promoting multiple users to a different role in one go
* Much, much more...
